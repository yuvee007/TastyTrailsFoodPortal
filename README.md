# Tasty Trails Food Portal
FOOD PORTAL MANAGEMENT

Introduction

Welcome to the The Tasty Trails Restaurant!

This project aims to solve the challenge of finding a quick and delicious meal in the hustle-bustle of our daily lives. This Food Portal is your digital haven for all your culinary cravings!

Whether you're an admin managing the portal or a hungry user eager to explore a world of delectable options, our portal ensures a smooth and delightful experience for all.


Description

Tasty Trails Food Portal is a beginner-friendly Python application integrated with MySQL to create a simple yet effective food ordering system. Built as a Class 12 Computer Science project, this portal allows users to explore a rich menu of dishes and place orders seamlessly, while admins have secure password-protected access to manage the menu and orders.

This project helped me learn how to connect Python with a real database and implement basic user authentication, menu management, and order processing—all through a command-line interface. It’s a practical introduction to backend programming and database connectivity.


Features

Admin Access: Unlock the Power

The admin has secure access through a password-protected interface. This allows managing orders, updating the menu, and overseeing the entire Food Portal with ease and precision.


Ordering Bliss: Explore and Indulge

Users can browse through a tempting menu showcasing a variety of dishes, each with its unique flavor. With just a few clicks, you can place your order and tantalize your taste buds with the finest cuisines.


Seamless Exit: You’re Way Out

Whether you’ve finished managing the admin block or are done placing an order, exiting the Food Portal is smooth and hassle-free — ready to welcome you back anytime for your next gastronomic adventure.
